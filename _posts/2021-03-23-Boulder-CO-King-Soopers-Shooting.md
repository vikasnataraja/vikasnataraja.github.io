Back in August 2018, I was flying from Boston to Denver with my brother and his then-fiance and as we were minutes away from landing, I looked out the window, saw Boulder lit by streetlights, and exclaimed "That's my town!". I was moving to Boulder to start a new life as a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and it has been my home ever since.

Nearly three years on, I am heartbroken to see what has just happened. [Boulder has had a mass shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/23/us/boulder-colorado-shooting/). I know Colorado is, unfortunately, not a stranger to mass shootings, just like the rest of the nation. I still remember reading about the Columbine school shooting years after it had happened, as well as the Aurora shooting in 2012. I was here in Boulder, in May 2019, studying at the Norlin Library when the STEM School in Highlands Ranch had a mass shooting and I was plugged into Twitter, in disbelief. Just last week, Atlanta had a race-related shooting. The pattern is all too similar. That is where my mind is dichotomous - We live in a world where this is all too common and we have almost accepted it as something to be expected; at the same time, you never think this could happen to your city, your town, your community.

 Boulder is a beautiful town. Everyone always talks about the mountains, the hiking trails, the weather. For me and for the locals here, it's more than that. It's the people who make Boulder beautiful. I've never felt more welcomed and part of a community than I have in Boulder. It has become my home and just like everyone who lives here, I have close-knit relationships with the people I see every day. The gas station workers, the people who work at our coffee shops, the staff at our favorite restaurants, the grocery store workers who have worked tirelessly through this already horrible past year.

Before I was watching it unfold yesterday afternoon, I was sat in my office at LASP, working on my paper and a big presentation for some people at NASA. I had just finished another one a few hours prior and was already anxious and exhausted. At 3:26 pm, I received an email on my phone from the University and it said CU Boulder Alert. I didn't read too much into it because I thought they were testing out the alert system, as they had been for a couple of weeks. But, I opened my phone and saw this:

"CU Alert: Boulder Police are responding to an active shooter at the King Soopers at Table Mesa and Broadway in south Boulder. AVOID THE AREA." the text read. And I immediately went into panic mode. Table Mesa and Broadway. That is where I live. That is where I shop. As a matter of fact, I was planning on going to that very grocery store to pick up some things for meal prep. And I read that text multiple times before I went on Twitter to see what was happening. I watched in horror, as I saw SWAT teams in their vans, dozens of police vehicles, ambulances, and emergency personnel swarming around the area. It was surreal. I started texting and calling my roommates and friends, many of whom shop there regularly, just like me. My hands started shaking and didn't stop for a long time. After I made sure they were okay, I started emailing my colleagues to make sure everyone was safe. It turned from surreal to real when I saw the Starbucks barista who I buy coffee from being escorted out by the police along with other employees. I knew these people and I could see the fear on their faces. I suddenly started remembering all the exchanges I had with the people there. I know the cashiers and the people who bag my produce as I check out. I know the person who works near the self-checkout kiosks who has the sweetest voice and never fails to say "Have a nice day!" as I'm leaving the store. I remember the people who work at the Customer Service Center. I know who restocks the shelves. I know the people who shop there. This is my community. These are my people. This was just horrifying to watch and I can't even begin to imagine what they must have felt, are feeling, and will feel.


All of this makes it hard to digest what has happened to my town. Not many things have hit me as hard as this one has. There was an eerie silence in my neighborhood today morning. Traffic seemed to have slowed as my friend and I walked along Table Mesa Dr to the intersection to put up signs showing our love for the victims. And that is how I want to remember this. I want to remember the victims - Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Teri Leiker, 51; Eric Talley, 51; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; Jodi Waters, 65. I don't want to mention the shooter or spend any time on him or know what his reasons were because to me, no reason can justify taking their lives. I would much rather honor the victims and think about their families. I want to know who they were as community members, what they did, how they lived, what their goals were and what little things they did to make this town better because I know they did.

I am completely heartbroken and my chest feels heavy. I cannot not think of the people affected. I want them to know that the people of Boulder and I are thinking about them. And as we mourn the victims, I want to remember them and preserve their memories and I hope you do too. But, I want to do more. Please tell me how I can help. Over the next few days, I will be looking out for GoFundMe pages, memorial services, and vigils so we can show our support and share our love for everyone affected by this and I will post them here. And I hope we can get through this together, as a community. Much love, Boulder.
