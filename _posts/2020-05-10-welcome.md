Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Vikas and I am a research assistant at the Laboratory for Atmospheric Physics in Boulder, CO, working with mostly machine learning. My main focus though is with robotics and autonomous vehicles and because of that, I get to do a lot of cool stuff. Now, as the title suggests, this blog is mostly a place for me to talk about machine learning in general, dive into some details about reinforcement learning and definitely and obviously, coffee! I'll be publishing my first blog on this revamped website (thanks [BeautifulJekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com)) about the basics of reinforcement learning so stay tuned for that. Speaking of websites, I am not a web developer and my knowledge of HTML and CSS are limited although I want to change that. So, as I learn more of that, this website will become better and I might even blog about that! But for now, that's all I had, thanks for stopping by and I'll see you next week with my first blog!
