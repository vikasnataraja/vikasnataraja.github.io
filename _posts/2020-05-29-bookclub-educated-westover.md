I don't know if it's because this is the first book I've read in more than three years or that it is, by itself, genuine and powerful but *Educated by Tara Westover* is one of the best books I've ever read. It should, of course, come as no surprise when you learn that it has received virtually every accolade one can think of: #1 on the New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller List, one of President Obama's Favorite Books of 2018, featured on Bill Gates's blog, Apple's Best Memoir of 2018 - need I go on?

Just 10 pages in, I started to realize why it has received such rave reviews when Westover reveals her family in South Idaho (near Buck's Peak) had Mormon survivalist beliefs (although the word "beliefs" might be an understatement) and believed in conspiracy theories about the Illuminati penetrating the ranks of the government. Her dad owned a junkyard and firmly believed the government was after his family and was always ready to flee for the mountains (or as the author describes it - 'we always had head-for-the-hills bags'). His distrust of the system was so deep that none of the children went to schools to be taught or to hospitals for any injuries and were instead treated by their mother who started off being a homemaker and then became a midwife, delivering children for people in the valley and eventually became an aromatherapist of sorts. The dad had a strange and definitely unhealthy outlook on how to raise his seven kids. Since there was no actual schooling, the kids were all homeschooled and were isolated from a normal life living in the valley. Most of the kids would work on the junkyard with their father, collecting scraps and metal from cars and appliances and reselling them to make a living for the family. Often, as a result of working with metal and heavy machinery, the kids would suffer injuries ranging from scratches to brain damage. Throughout the book, the author recounts countless tales of her and her siblings being subject to many accidents, each more harrowing than the one before with their dad being ever so indifferent and always believing that God would heal them. She explains repeatedly that she was not a normal kid and rarely had friends growing up because most other Mormons were more modern and did not have similar beliefs as her dad and therefore the kids were not allowed to interact with them. It makes for a painful and heart-breaking tale of a kid growing up with almost no sense of what the real or normal world looked like and boxed in to believe whatever her dad told her was real.

One story that particularly stuck with me was that of her brother Luke when he suffered an accident working in the junkyard like most of his siblings and his leg caught on fire. You'd think that his dad would come to his rescue and put out the fire and take him to a hospital but her dad did none of that. Westover recollects that her dad decided to put out the fire in the fields and her brother limped a mile home screaming, half-conscious, and ended up nearly losing his leg. Another bizarre story was that of her dad's near-death accident when he lit a fire near a vehicle's gas tank at the junkyard that caused a huge explosion and with his skin burned, face melted, barely conscious, he chose to walk home and have his wife bring him back to life and at one point told his wife - "I'd rather die here than go to the hospital". At various stages of these disturbing tales, I began to wonder - is this even real? Did this really happen? I was nearly always left in shock and perhaps even sheer disbelief that something like that could have happened. But it did and credit where it's due, Westover's narration is impeccable and keeps you immersed and craving for that moment when it all changes and the father comes to terms with what he's done and you get a happy ending kind of like in a movie where the guy realizes he's been not been a good boyfriend and asks for forgiveness and gets back together with the girl.

A major character in the book is one of her older brothers Shawn (she uses Shawn as a pseudonym) who at various times physically abuses Westover in public and at home in front of the family and emotionally scars her for life. And just like with the dad, you keep hoping that he changes, that he realizes his mistakes and becomes a better person. But sadly, he does not, and if anything, becomes worse as the story moves. Westover masterfully entices you with glimpses of how he could be the nicest brother ever in one moment but a monster the next. Like when she is visiting her family from England, he drives her around town, shows her a good time, chats about life, behaves like a good brother and then on the way back threatens to kill their younger sister Audrey for complaining about his abuse to their parents. And again, I was left to wonder - "did it really happen?" and the mere fact that I as a reader had to ask myself such questions reading a piece of non-fiction was quite shrewd on the part of the author. Under such extraordinarily difficult circumstances, it is remarkable that she even got out of that atmosphere of abuse and toxicity and went on to get a PhD from Cambridge.

Westover's riveting narrative style demands the reader's attention that I've only seen matched in Trevor Noah's memoir *Born A Crime* which was also highly mesmeric and is the best book that I've ever read. However, one criticism I do have of her approach to writing is that sometimes she is too modest when talking about her achievements and chooses to glance over some details about her college life and underplays it in a way that becomes close to appearing fake at some point. Perhaps she does it to usher her family into focus as the protagonists and have the reader pay more attention to them instead of her own educational and academic life and she largely achieves that through first person narration, bringing every character to life in a very realistic and immersive way that I was transported to the mountains and was with there with her.

*Educated* is a striking memoir that is in equal parts gut-wrenching and horrifying. Westover artfully takes you through her journey, recanting tales of her childhood through her adult life and strikes an exquisite balance between wanting more and wishing nothing bad happened. This book should be on top of everyone's summer reading lists and is guaranteed to leave you both aghast and amazed at the same time.
