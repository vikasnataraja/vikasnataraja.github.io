Welcome to my very first blog on this new revamped website! I decided to write this blog about Reinforcement Learning because it is an area of Artificial Intelligence that I am absolutely fascinated by! The applications of RL are quite simply beyond what I can imagine and so in this post, I will attempt to explain the basics of RL.

<p><strong> What is Reinforcement Learning?</strong></p>
<!-- ### What is Reinforcement Learning? -->

Simply put, Reinforcement Learning is where an agent in an environment is trying to maximize or optimize the way it behaves to achieve a certain *reward*. But wait, what is this "agent" and what is this "reward"? To answer that, let's consider an example:

You're playing fetch with your dog and every time she (that's right, **she**) brings the ball back to you, you give it a treat. Not that you should play this game for long because you would run out of treats pretty soon but in this scenario, the dog is the agent. She knows that every time she's successful in bringing the ball back to you, she gets a treat. So you could say, she is trying to get the reward (treat) by taking some action (fetching the ball).
