            <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my graduate career, I've taken on several teaching roles in various capacities. While there are many aspects that I love about teaching, connecting and interacting with students is my favorite. There are always questions they ask that force me to re-think how I can explain a concept in a different way. And that, I find, is particularly useful when writing a research paper or giving a talk.
            </p>
            <p>
                I received a fellowship from the University of Colorado's Center for Teaching and Learning in 2023 and I currently serve as my department's Lead TA. As a part of this role, I regularly meet with other TAs in the department to check in on how their classes are going and what we are doing good (and bad) which I then use as feedback to the faculty and leadership to improve pedagogy and overall teaching experience.
