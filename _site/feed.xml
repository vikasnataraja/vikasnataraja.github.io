        <title>Boulder - My town, my people</title>
        <description>
          
          Back in August 2018, I was flying from Boston to Denver with my brother and his then-fiance and as we were minutes away from landing, I looked out the window, saw Boulder lit by streetlights, and exclaimed “That’s my town!”. I was moving to Boulder to start a new life...

        <title>Bias in Artificial Intelligence</title>
        <description>
          How bias manifests in facial recognition and social media - 
          There is increasing scrutiny surrounding machine learning algorithms and how they can go wrong very badly. Facial recognition is a topic that has gathered momentum in recent years with companies like Clearview AI providing the technology to law enforcement to, according to their website, “track down hundreds of at-large criminals,...

        <title>Understanding Bias and Variance in Machine Learning</title>
        <description>
          A look at the bias-variance trade-off in the world of ML - 
          If you’ve taken a machine learning class, chances are they told you about bias and variance or the bias-variance trade-offs you make in ML. Well, it turns out they are super important and in this blog I’ll talk about what bias and variance are in the context of machine learning,...

        <title>Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
        <description>
          Convolution, filters, layers and feature extraction - 
          Neural networks have truly transformed the way machine learning and AI in general are perceived and to an extent, researched. They have gone from the fringes of the CS community where only select academics in the late 1980s would publish a paper occasionally to becoming synonymous with artificial intelligence and...

        <title>BookClub - Educated by Tara Westover</title>
        <description>
          My thoughts on Tara Westover's powerful memoir - 
          I don’t know if it’s because this is the first book I’ve read in more than three years or that it is, by itself, genuine and powerful but Educated by Tara Westover is one of the best books I’ve ever read. It should, of course, come as no surprise when...
