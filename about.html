      Hey there! I'm Vikas Nataraja, a research assistant at the Laboratory for Atmospheric Phyiscs (LASP). I design and experiment with various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and models, particularly in the field of self-driving cars. So if you want to talk about self-driving vehicles, robotics, machine learning, coffee, how vim is better than emacs, soccer, hit me up! <a href="mailto:viha4393@colorado.edu">Email Me</a>, connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikas-hanasoge-nataraja/">LinkedIn</a> or follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/vikasnataraja">Twitter</a> and check out my <a href="https://www.github.com/vikasnataraja">Github</a>!

      I am a graduate student at CU Boulder working primarily on autonomous vehicles and writing software for other applications of Deep Learning. On the AVs side, I work on the Perception side of things with camera and lidar data, designing convolutional neural networks to decipher features like humans do on a regular basis. More recently, I have been working a lot on Reinforcement Learning, check out my <a href="https://vikasnataraja.github.io/blog/">blog</a>!

      Currently I work as a Research Assistant at the <a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/">Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Phyiscs</a> with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/atoc/sebastian-schmidt">Dr. Sebastian Schmidt</a> to use machine learning to predict Cloud Optical Thickness from cloud radiances. The idea is to design a CNN to quickly estimate the Cloud Optical Thickness or COT based on a 3D radiative transfer model. In simpler words, calculate the optical thickness of clouds in images taken from a Sky-View camera by taking into account the radiative transfer (geometry and spectral distribution of radiation) through clouds. This is one of the first times I have had the chance to use Deep Learning in a field other than autonomous vehicles or robotics and I'm very excited for it. We started with a PSPNet-based framework/backbone but quickly switched to other complex architectures which have produced some incredible results. I'm pretty pumped about it, stay tuned for our paper!

    In the last couple of years, I have had the opportunity to work on some truly fascinating topics. In the summer of 2019, I interned as a Software Engineer with <a href="https://allvision.io/">Allvision IO</a> in Pittsburgh, PA where I worked on building and training a Faster R-CNN and an SSD model to detect license plates in a video stream. In my 3 months at Allvision, I wrote an end-to-end pipeline to grab the images from the dataset, preprocess them, feed them into my model which produces 2D coordinate bounding boxes which are then sent to OpenALPR for license plate character recognition. My model performed quite well on Pittsburgh's Strip District and East Liberty datasets which were the only two available to me at the time.

      More recently, I was a Teaching Assistant for a couple of courses - ECEN 2703 Discrete Math for Computer Engineers with Dr. Fabio Somenzi and ATOC 4815 Data Visualization with Python with Dr. Sebastian Schmidt. While both courses were immensely exciting to teach, the latter was so much fun because I had the chance to create new course content and teach Python and Machine Learning to students who had never even heard or experimented with it. It presented a new challenge to me since I mostly run in Computer Science and AV circles where  it is quite safe to assume that people have heard about these kind of topics and brought me back to my roots and forced me to re-learn some topics I had forgotten about. One of my more exciting ventures for sure!

      In addition to these experiences, I also lead the ADCS Software Engineering Team for the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/project/maxwellcubesat/our-mission">Maxwell CubeSat</a> mission where I work on Attitude Determination and Control Systems problems for the satellite. Specifically, I develop Flight Software to use perception (from sensors) and control the motion of the satellite using actuators. Currently, it is scheduled to be delivered to the US Air Force Research Lab by early 2021 with a tentative launch date in the fall of 2021. The biggest reason why I joined this project in the first place in spite of it not being my focus area was the opportunity to take my work on Perception systems in AVs and use them in the real world and learn about control systems which hasn't always particularly been my cup of tea. Plus, we get to launch an actual satellite that will fly in space which is pretty cool!
